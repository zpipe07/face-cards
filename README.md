# Face Cards

Much of the work at SendGrid involves pulling in data from multiple sources and combining them into one, cohesive presentation.

This problem is separated into two tasks. First, display three "cards" for randomly-selected users which displays their name, email address, company catchphrase, and, of course, their adorable avatar. Second, display 5 randomly-selected posts when a user clicks on an individual card.


## General Requirements

1. Use React, Jest, and your favorite library for managing state to create the simple application described below.
2. Write clean, concise, self-documenting code.
3. Write small, easily-testable components.
4. Write unit tests and ensure code coverage.

Familiarize yourself with the [Jest documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

## Time Expectations

We would expect this task to only take about 3 hours to complete. It's okay to go over if you're enjoying yourself, but if you go too much beyond please add some comments on how you would see yourself finishing this, what changes you might make, etc. and make your submission.

## Technical Requirements

### Part 1

1. Fetch user data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` via AJAX.
2. Select three unique users at random.
3. Display a card for each of the three randomly selected users (see mockups below).
4. Cards are 350px by 206px.
5. The avatar images are provided by `http://avatars.adorable.io`. The `<img>` element's `src` attribute will be in the format of `https://api.adorable.io/avatars/150/<email>.png`.
6. You may use any JavaScript library not already provided to achieve the desired functionality.

### Part 2

1. When a user clicks on a card, perform an AJAX request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=<USER ID>`.
2. Select five unique posts at random.
3. Display the title and body of each post below the original three cards (see the mockups below).
4. The title should always render Capitalized Words.
